###### What is NumPy?

> Numpy (or Numerical Python)  is the core library for scientific computing in Python.  It provides a high-performance multidimensional array object. A numpy array is a grid of values, all of the same type. 

> This library can be used for different functions in Linear algebra, Matrix computations, Fourier Transforms. Alongside Numpy is most suitable for performing basic numerical computations such as mean, median, range, etc.

> It is an open source module of Python which provides fast mathematical computation on arrays and matrices. Since, arrays and matrices are an essential part of the Machine Learning ecosystem.

> Python in combination with Numpy, Scipy, Matplotlib and Pandas can be used as a replacement for MATLAB.

###### Numpy in Machine Learning!

Numpy can be used in all common classes of problem in Machine Learning. **Example: Classification, Regressoin, Clustering etc.**

Machine learning uses vectors. Vectors are one-dimensional arrays. It can be represented either as a row or as a column array.

*Say we built a ML algo to classify videos on YouTube into 3 categories (good, spam, viral) based on what we know about them. For each video, we would have a vector representing what we know about it, such as: [10.0, 10.5, 5.2, 3.25, 7000.0]. This vector could represent a video that has 10 likes, which lasts 10.5 minutes, but only 5.2% viewers watch for more than a minute, it gets 3.25 views per day on average, and it has 7000 dislikes.*

Based on this vector, our Machine Learning system may predict that there is an 80% probability that it is a spam video, 2% that it is viral, and 12% that it is a good video. This could be represented as the following vector: 
      
      class_probabilities = [0.8,0.18,0.02].

But all these ML algorithms are computation heavy which runs on huge datasets at the sametime. Hence traditional python data structures like Lists may not be useful in this case.

###### Why Numpy?
*NumPy's arrays are more compact than Python lists.*

- It consumes less memory.

- It is fast as compared to the python List. [How? Let's check!](https://github.com/robagwe/kick-off-numpy/blob/master/speed.ipynb)

- It is convenient to use.

### :coffee: Ingredients:

- numpy
- python3
- Jupyter Notebook
- Anaconda
- Ubuntu 16.4 LTS


#### :heavy_exclamation_mark: I run on Mac OS/Ubuntu so you might have to slightly modify the code to make it work in your env.

> This repository explains the rationale for numpy array in python environment.
:warning: I am not much into core data analytics and thus could not cover all features of numpy. But the actual reason behind this kick-off session is that I found this library quite amazing while dealing with different Machine Learning Algorithms and  NLP tasks. If you are ML/NLP/NLU/NLG or Deep NNs (RNN) enthusiast please have a look at my kick-off repos below:
